# stardate

While looking through my old laptop for files (RIP 2011-2019) I remembered I wrote this short thing for in a silly and fun little way displaying a "stardate" with 5 digits and a decimal point in the Star Trek: The Next Generation style in the best way I knew how to render the time as a long number in our present day, by just displaying Unix time in that way. I had it display on my desktop ^_^ like so:

When rendered as this many digits before the decimal the "date" increments approximately once every 1.16 days. If you used certain forums and message boards in the mid-2000s and 2010s which named their uploaded files by unix time like me you became accustomed to getting a feel for the time an image was uploaded by its filename eg. ```1715250051.png```
